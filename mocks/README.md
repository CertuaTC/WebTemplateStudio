# Generated Templates

This folder is for the development of the final boilerplate code that will be generated by Web Template Studio. The react mocks have been converted to templates that the engine can use but the vue mocks have not been converted yet. The templates can be found in the template folder in the root of the project.

## React

Contains the list, grid and master detail pages made with React front-end and Express back-end. The React front-end is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the Express back-end is based on the [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

The React templates can be run using:

`yarn install` or `npm install`
`yarn start` or `npm start`

After starting the web app the front-end will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and the back-end will be available at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/). Further details can be found in the README located in the `react-mocks` folder.

## Vue

Contains the list, grid and master detail pages made with Vue front-end and Express back-end. The Vue front end is based on [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and the Express back-end is based on the [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

The Vue templates can be run using:

`yarn install` or `npm install`
`yarn start` or `npm start`

After starting the web app the front-end will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and the back-end will be available at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/). Further details can be found in the README located in the `vue-mocks` folder
